    <h3>education and achievements</h3>
    <p id="education">  i began my schorlastic jouurney at the age of 2 in <u>Madonna Montessori nursery and primary
            School</u> which ranged from 2002 - 2012. From primary school i have always been reserved thus  was not really
            part of groups which has grown to be a part of me. i did my secondary school in <u>Hope Waddell Training 
            Institution</u> from 2012 - 2018. During my time in secondary school i was well behaved which made my teachers 
            quite fond of me. My favourite subject then was Technical Drawing, i never went below 80 marks, during my 
            graduation  ceremony i was awarded a cash prize for my distinguished performance in that subject. Unlike Most 
            of my mates my path after secondary school was deviated, during this time i learned  a vast amount of soft skills 
            and even gained some working experience before enrolling in higher institution. Today i am currently pursuing
            two degrees in computer science, one in <a href="www.uopeople.com">University of the people</a>  the other here at 
            <a href="www.aptech.com">APTECH</a> some of the skills i possess are listed below.
